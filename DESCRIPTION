Description: Capture screenshots in 'Shiny' applications. Screenshots can either be
    of the entire viewable page, or a specific section of the page. The captured
    image is automatically downloaded as a PNG image, or it can also be saved on
    the server. Powered by the 'html2canvas' JavaScript library.
